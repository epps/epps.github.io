# [`epps.github.io`](https://epps.github.io) v2

## Background

The initial version of `epps.github.io` was a pilfered Bootstrap theme for the purposes of getting my first job after completing Hack Reactor in 2015. At the time, I thought it looked slick, and it came with a jQuery plugin that pulled in my GitHub activityâ€”extra points, right? I deployed it using GitHub pages, and promptly forgot it existed.

Over the years, I returned to `epps.github.io` purely to make updates while on a job hunt; however, with each year of experience, my opinion of the site sank to the point where it embarrassed me. I didn't have aspirations to make anything polished. I just wanted something that was more mine than the original.

## Motivation

At the time of writing, I'm nearing five complete years of on-the-job programming experience, and this milestone brings with it some observations. I find my appetite for general computing concepts has grown to the point where I reading into and learning about topics that I would have caused my imposter syndrome to flair up years ago.

Before I learned out to program, I was a writer, so I'm trained to process thoughts through writing. Given that I've got bigger thoughts to process, I figured it was time to start writing and doing so in a way that would keep me accountable: in public. Hence v2 of `epps.github.io`.

## Goals

As much as I'm prone to rabbit holes and tangents, my primary goal with `epps.github.io` v2 is to have a simple tool to publish blog posts (i.e public notes) about whatever topic I'm thinking the most about. The goal meant that:

- I am perfectly fine with continuing to use GitHub pages to deploy my site
- I don't want to focus on the look/design of the sign
- I prefer a flow that would allow me to write in Markdown as I'm already comfortable doing so on the job

This sets the bar pretty low, which is nice, because it means I won't have spent more than a couple of nights setting things up.

## Materials Used

I landed on [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) primarily because I've been hearing a lot about it and I was curious. Plus, I recently snagged an annual subscription to [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) and there are more than a few resources to get up and running with Gatsby.

Specifically, [Taylor Bell](https://egghead.io/instructors/taylor-bell)'s course [Build a Blog with React and Markdown using Gatsby](https://egghead.io/courses/build-a-blog-with-react-and-markdown-using-gatsby) provided all the information I needed to achieve my goal of writing in Markdown.

Additionally, I decided to use [new.css](https://newcss.net/) after reading about it on Hacker News because it allowed me to write semantic HTML and get the CSS for free. It's dead simple and attractive; I'm really enjoying it.
