Despite this, I never kept a blog prior learning how to program, and even though I've advised others to keep a small tech blog to round out their online personas for hiring purposes, I've never taken my own advice. Until now.</p>
<p>An interesting confluence of events have recently steered me towards the idea of ripping out my previous personal site root and stock to prepare soil for something more genuinely my own and reflective of where I'm currently at in my trajectory:</p>
<ul>
<li>An edition of the <a href="https://egghead.io">egghead.io</a> email newsletter from <a href="https://joelhooks.com/">Joel Hooks</a>, which encouraged the resurgence of personal blogging</li>
<li>A tweet mentioning <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public">Sean Swyx Wang's <em>Learning in Public</em></a>, which sketched out a path for making my learning more impactful and accountable</li>
<li>Signing up for <a href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</a>, whose admission of no-editing/polish and request for feedback was a refreshing reminder that the process of creating should be my focus, not the final product</li>
<li>A post on Hacker New, <a href="https://muldoon.cloud/programming/2020/04/17/programming-rules-thumb.html">Rules of thumb for a 1x developer</a>, which resonated with my angst around being a 1x dev who knows he could be a 1.1x dev—hell, maybe even 1.2x dev—if he could only find the time to study</li>
<li>Joining a small startup with an engineering culture of shared responsibility for documentation, which led me to view my technical writing with a more critical eye</li>
<li>Taking note (pun intended) of people proselytizing the note-taking ... er ... knowledge-architecting tool <a href="http://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a> on Twitter, which led me to question how I take notes and organize knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>These influences oriented me less towards a blog in the sense that I've always understood it (i.e. a polished collection of public thoughts for people to consume, share, and comment on) and more towards something that has me move my private learning practice into the light of the public sphere<sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup>. So I've decided <code>epps.github.io</code> will be my public-facing notepad.</p>
<p>I've chosen <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages">GitHub Pages</a> because it offers the dead-simplest way for me reach my goal of removing the previous site and bootstrapping a new one with at least one post by the end of this week<sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup>. <del>Additionally, it comes with the feature of exposing my process of learning how to build a personal site with <a href="gatsbyjs.org">Gatsby</a> at the same time it provides a platform for the site itself. At the time of writing, there is nothing more than a home page that lists posts, and a page for each of these posts. This leaves a lot of room for growth and gives readers<sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> a view onto how it takes place.</del><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup></p>
<p>At this point, I haven't decided on any goals for my publishing cadence; however, I'm striving to push out one note per week. Given I've arrived at a place where writing decent prose isn't as stilted and painful as it used to be for me, I don't see why this shouldn't be possible.</p>
<p>I'll close this first post by inviting ferocious feedback on my notes from you, dear reader<sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup>. You won't be doing me any favors by not correcting my mistakes or not offering a reasoned counterpoint to whatever idea I happen to be fixated on that week.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1" class="footnote-ref">1</a></sup> "Public sphere" is a grandiose term for simply having a publicly facing site given I currently have no intention of driving traffic to my musings.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2" class="footnote-ref">2</a></sup> Given how inconsistent my free time is and how scattered learning habits are, being able to meet this goal is far more valuable than it might seem.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3" class="footnote-ref">3</a></sup> This should really be "reader" in the singular, as I fully expect to be the only person reading my public notes. But hey, why not inject a bit of aspiration wherever possible, right?</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-4"><a href="#fn-4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> I guess the first step towards walking the walk takes place less than a minute after publishing: I'd overlooked the fact that deploying to the repo <code>epps.github.io</code> via the <a href="https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages"><code>gh-pages</code></a> tool meant that only thing under version control on my remote branch is the build artifact, whereas my local branch holds the commits behind this artifact.</p>
<p><sup id="fnref-5"><a href="#fn-5" class="footnote-ref">5</a></sup> This is easy to say given I've provided you with no forum in which to log your feedback. I should put that on my to-do list.</p></section></article></section></div><div id="gatsby-announcer" style="position:absolute;top:0;width:1px;height:1px;padding:0;overflow:hidden;clip:rect(0, 0, 0, 0);white-space:nowrap;border:0" aria-live="assertive" aria-atomic="true"></div></div><script id="gatsby-script-loader">/*<![CDATA[*/window.pagePath="/mvp";/*]]>*/</script><script id="gatsby-chunk-mapping">/*<![CDATA[*/window.___chunkMapping={"app":["/app-465226c7e6ba7342d754.js"],"component---src-pages-index-js":["/component---src-pages-index-js-f7819f4c41b238c529d5.js"],"component---src-templates-blog-post-js":["/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-f32733b6a3e1056f4d4c.js"]};/*]]>*/</script><script src="/component---src-templates-blog-post-js-f32733b6a3e1056f4d4c.js" async=""></script><script src="/app-465226c7e6ba7342d754.js" async=""></script><script src="/framework-43898561dafbdf32aefd.js" async=""></script><script src="/webpack-runtime-e86b41c4651ab76bf773.js" async=""></script></body></html>
